# My Portfolio

My personal website that highlights recent projects I've completed as well as personal projects I have completed/am currently working on.

**Full Website:**

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

Work on CSS breakpoints some more -still needs phone breakpoints added, find bugs, replace panels with Projects

## Lessons Learned:

I've implemented and combined several smaller projects that I've been working on to build this site including the rotating navigation menu, waving form, expanding panels and the modal form for smaller screens
