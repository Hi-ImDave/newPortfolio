# My Portfolio

My personal website that highlights recent projects I've completed as well as personal projects I have completed/am currently working on.

**Full Website:**

## How It's Made:

I had 3 main goals I wanted to accomplish with this project:

1. Build a fully responsive website without the use of any CSS frameworks
2. Limit the site to a single page for all screen sizes with nothing rendering below the fold
3. Improve my CSS skills and increase comfort with DOM manipulation

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

1. Work on CSS breakpoints some more. Need Phone and Tablet Landscape fixes.
2. add github repos and hosting links to projects
3. better background for projects on laptops and up.
4. phone screen tweak carousel image sizes. maybe make them background img for inner divs
5. find bugs

## Lessons Learned:

I've implemented and combined several smaller projects that I've been working on to build this site including the rotating navigation menu, waving form, expanding panels and the modal form for smaller screens.
